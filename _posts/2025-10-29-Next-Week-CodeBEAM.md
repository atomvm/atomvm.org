# Next Week: AtomVM Takes the Stage at CodeBEAM Berlin 2025

We're excited to announce that AtomVM will be featured in two compelling talks at CodeBEAM Berlin 2025 next week! Join us to learn about the latest developments in running BEAM languages on microcontrollers and beyond.

## Paul Guyot - Adding JIT to AtomVM
**November 5th, 2025**

[Paul Guyot](https://github.com/pguyot/) will present how just-in-time compilation is being brought to AtomVM, the virtual machine for microcontrollers. He'll compare AtomVM's approach with the BEAM's BeamASM, focusing on the unique challenges of compiling on devices with as little as 128 KB of RAM and maintaining portability across multiple architectures (RISCV, ARM32, Xtensa, WASM). The talk will also reveal how LLMs are helping tackle this complex engineering challenge.

## Davide Bettio - AtomVM: Unlocking the Power of BEAM on Tiny Microcontrollers and Beyond
**November 6th, 2025**

[Davide Bettio](https://github.com/bettio/) will demonstrate running Erlang, Elixir, and Gleam on palm-sized devices, showcasing AtomVM's unique position in the embedded BEAM ecosystem. With practical examples in all three languages, he'll explore IoT applications and beyond, including WebAssembly support and running BEAM languages directly in browsers. The session will provide actionable insights for building small-footprint applications across diverse environments.

## Can't Make It to Berlin?

For those unable to attend CodeBEAM Berlin, we encourage you to check out these excellent recent talks from previous conferences to learn more about AtomVM:

- [La Machine: The Useless Box reloaded with Erlang and AtomVM - Paul Guyot | Code BEAM Europe 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-uCKdHz-wM)
- [Microcontrollers with Gleam - Ray De Los Santos | Code BEAM America 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jd1lRQ4LZg)
- [Keynote: The AtomVM and New Horizons for Elixir - Davide Bettio & Mateusz Front | ElixirConf EU 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep--rQO1FRI)

We look forward to seeing you at CodeBEAM Berlin 2025 or connecting with you through our community channels. These talks represent the cutting edge of BEAM technology on embedded systems, and we're thrilled to share our progress with the broader BEAM community.
