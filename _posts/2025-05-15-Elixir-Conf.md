# 2025/05/15 Unveiling Popcorn at ElixirConf EU 2025 Keynote: New Horizons for Client-Side Elixir

We're thrilled to share exciting news from the recent [ElixirConf EU](https://www.elixirconf.eu/) 2025! The first keynote, "The AtomVM and New Horizons for Elixir," presented by [Davide Bettio](https://uninstall.it/) and [Mateusz Front](https://github.com/mat-hek), introduced a groundbreaking new library called [Popcorn](https://github.com/software-mansion/popcorn).

For those who missed the keynote, you can watch it here: [Keynote: The AtomVM and New Horizons for Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep--rQO1FRI).

Popcorn is set to revolutionize how we think about client-side development with Elixir: Popcorn is a powerful library that enables you to run Elixir code directly within web browsers (using WASM and AtomVM under the hood).

This keynote not only delved into the advancements of AtomVM but also showcased the immense potential of Popcorn in expanding Elixir's reach to new frontiers. We encourage you to explore the Popcorn library and see how it can enhance your web development projects.

Stay tuned for more updates as Popcorn continues to evolve!
