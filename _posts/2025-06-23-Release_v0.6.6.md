## 2025/06/23 Announcing AtomVM v0.6.6

We are excited to announce the release of AtomVM v0.6.6!

First, a quick note for users of [OTP-28](https://www.erlang.org/news/180):
Unfortunately, **this release does not yet include support for OTP-28**. We recommend using a supported version such as OTP-27 for the best experience with AtomVM v0.6.6.

That said, if you're eager to experiment, our main development branch includes support for OTP-28. We strive to keep up with the latest OTP changes, so adventurous users are welcome to try it out—with the usual caution that comes with using a development branch.

If you're on macOS, be aware that both [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) now default to OTP-28. To install an earlier version, you can use:
```sh
brew install erlang@27
```

Alternatively, consider using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) to manage multiple Erlang/OTP versions with ease.

Also note: since MacPorts has already moved to OTP-28, AtomVM v0.6.6 will not be available on MacPorts.

This release includes a vast number of changes and improvmenets, for the full set of bug fixes, changes and additions consult the
[Changelog](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.6/CHANGELOG.html).

Download images and binaries are available for most platforms, except STM32, are available from
[AtomVM Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/releases/tag/v0.6.6). STM32 users as
well as anyone needing to build a generic_unix port for a device without release binaries should
consult the [Build Instructions](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.6/build-instructions.html). MacOS
users also have the option of
[installing with `macports`](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.6/getting-started-guide.html#installation-on-macos).

The git repository and tarballs of the AtomVM source release for all platforms can be found on our
[GitHub AtomVM page](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM).

Documentation for the v0.6.6 release of the AtomVM virtual machine, including a
[Getting Started Guide](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.6/getting-started-guide.html), can be found in the
[AtomVM Documentation](https://doc.atomvm.org/v0.6.6/).

As always, tools, drivers, and modules are available on the
[GitHub AtomVM Project page](https://github.com/atomvm).

This release wouldn’t be here without the awesome work of our contributors: [Davide Bettio](https://github.com/bettio/), [Paul Guyot](https://github.com/pguyot/), [Winford](https://github.com/UncleGrumpy), [Peter M](https://github.com/petermm), and [everyone else who contributed](https://github.cogm/atomvm/AtomVM/graphs/contributors).

Many thanks to as well to the [bug reporters](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM/issues) who have helped make this release possible.
