# ðŸŽ™ 2025/06/24 AtomVM is going live on FLOSS Weekly!

[Davide Bettio](https://uninstall.it/) and [Paul Guyot](https://github.com/pguyot) will be chatting with the [FLOSS Weekly](http://hackaday.com/floss) crew today at 2:30 PM UTC about AtomVM. Expect deep dives into why AtomVM exists, how it works, and where itâ€™s headed.

This is an opportunity to hear from two of the core contributors about what makes AtomVM special, how it fits into the embedded development space, and how you can get involved.

Tune in live or catch the recording later â€” and spread the word! ðŸ’¡
