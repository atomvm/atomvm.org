# Tooling, Drivers, and Libraries

Several users in the AtomVM community have provided extensions to AtomVM to support integrations
with specific peripherals and networking protocols.  These extensions are growing and currently
include the following.

## Tools
* [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_rebar3_plugin) A Rebar3 plugin for
streamlining the development of AtomVM applications written in Erlang
* [`ExAtomVM`](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) A Mix plugin for streamlining the development of
AtomVM applications written in Elixir
* [`atomvm_packbeam`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_packbeam) Purerlang version of AtomVM
PackBeam utility
* [`uf2tool`](https://github.com/pguyot/uf2tool) Erlang escript to work with .uf2 files

## Drivers

### Nif and port based drivers
* [`atomgl`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomgl) AtomGL is a display driver for a number of different
display models and technologies
* [`atomvm_dht`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_dht) ESP32 DHT11 and DHT12 drivers for AtomVM
* [`atomvm_esp32cam`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_esp32cam) An AtomVM Nif for interfacing with
cameras connected to the ESP32
* [`atomvm_gps`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_gps) Support for GPS device integration
(using ESP-IDF UART/NMEA) on AtomVM
* [`atomvm_led_strip`](https://github.com/harmon25/atomvm_led_strip) ESP32 RMT Nifs for WS2812 and
SK6812 Addressable LEDs (recommended replacement for `atomvm_neopixel` if you need the performance
of a nif based driver)

* [`atomvm_nvs_reset`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_nvs_reset) An IDF component that supports
resetting NVS by holding a pin
* [`atomvm_ssd1306`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_ssd1306) AtomVM ESP32 driver for SSD1306
displays
* [`atomvm_ulp`](https://github.com/pguyot/atomvm_ulp) ESP32 ULP Driver
* [`avm_epdiy_display`](https://github.com/atomvm/avm_epdiy_display) AtomVM EPDiy E-Paper Display
Driver

### BEAM based drivers
* [`atomvm_lib`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_lib) A rich set of libraries for integrating
various sensors and peripherals, including:

    - BH1750 Luminosity sensors
    - SHT3X Temperature and humidity sensor
* [`atomvm_lora`](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_lora) SX127X LoRa modem drivers and libraries
* [`avm_ls`](https://github.com/karlsson/avm_ls) Pure BEAM (Native support for Erlang, Elixir, and
Gleam!) driver for WS2812, SK9822, and AP102 Addressable LEDs (recommended pure BEAM replacement
for `atomvm_neopixel`)

## Libraries
* [`avm_scene`](https://github.com/atomvm/avm_scene) An OTP display orchestration application
* [`mjson`](https://github.com/mbj4668/mjson) Purerlang JSON encoder and decoder designed for
